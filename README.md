# 2024 Sri Lanka Presidential Election Results Analysis using Power BI 📊

### The project focused on:

📍 Sri Lanka Map Design: Designed a custom map marking the boundaries of the 22 electoral districts using simplemaps.com

📍 Electoral Districts: Visualized votes and percentages for major candidates (Anura, Sajith and Ranil) across all 22 districts.

📍 Dynamic Visuals: Built interactive dashboards where users can filter data by district, dynamically displaying district-specific results. 

📍 Key Insights: The dashboard enabled me to dive deep into voting patterns, highlighting key electoral trends and providing meaningful insights for future election strategies.

📍 Impactful Visualizations: Used stacked bar charts, cards, and other visuals to present data clearly and effectively.
Eager to leverage these insights in upcoming data-driven initiatives!
